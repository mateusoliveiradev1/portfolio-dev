# Dev Portfolio

This project contains my personal portfolio built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**. Animations are powered by **Framer Motion**.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` &ndash; start the development server with hot reloading.
- `npm run build` &ndash; create an optimized production build.
- `npm start` &ndash; run the built app.
- `npm run lint` &ndash; check for lint issues using ESLint.
- `npm test` &ndash; run unit tests via Vitest.

## Tests

Vitest is configured for running tests. Execute all tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

At the moment there are no test files, but the command is ready for future tests.

## Usage

After starting the dev server, open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to view the portfolio.
